# Winmerge-Windows-Mac-thumbnail-filter
This filter is intended to filter out the "hidden" file created by Windows or Mac OS while you wish to use WinMerge to compare your files for e.g. manual syncing 2 directory

This filter exclude:
- Thumbs.db
- Desktop.ini
- ._.DS_Store
- All file start with ._ (e.g. ._YoureBeautiful.jpg, ._RickRoll.avi)

## Note
This is my first project, it is not rigourously tested, please use with caution!

Worked on 2.16.4 with Windows 7 (not tested on other version)
