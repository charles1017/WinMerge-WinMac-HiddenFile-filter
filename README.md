# Winmerge-Windows-Mac-thumbnail-filter

This is my first time project, it is not rigourously tested, please use with caution!

This filter is intended to filter out the "hidden" & not pleasant file while you wish to use WinMerge to compare your files for e.g. manual syncing 2 directory

This filter exclude:
Thumbs.db
Desktop.ini
._.DS_Store
All file start with ._ (e.g. ._YoureBeautiful.jpg, ._RickRoll.avi)

Worked on 2.16.4 (not tested on other version)
